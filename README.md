## Project Description
Metro Efrei Dodo is a Python application that helps users find the shortest path in the Paris metro system. The application provides two versions of data to choose from, each with its own unique features and capabilities.

### Version 1
The first version is the most basic one, providing a metro map and the ability to calculate the shortest path between two stations. The graph in this version is not directed. This version is efficient and fast but lacks updates or new data.

### Version 2
The second version includes IDFM 2024 data, the graph is directed and contains more information. This version is more complex and less efficient but includes more data and is more accurate.

## Installation and Usage
To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `main.py` to start the application.
4. Choose the data version you want to use.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to find the shortest path between two metro stations.
